Repository used to store reverse engineering technical challenge task

## Task Description

- We are trying to reverse engineer a legacy application, given its url and an authentication credential.

## Plan Description

- The first step was to analyze the application using a web browser and web inspector tools to verify the requests and responses.

- Next, we created the typescript project to simulate the requests and responses of the application in the command line.

- The tools used were:
  - Node.js
  - TypeScript
  - fetch Cookie
  - node fetch
- The code was written in TypeScript to ensure type safety and better maintainability.

- The platform used cookies for handling sessions, and has a private API for the resources (users)
